# 📊 Sales Performance & Operations Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes online sales data to identify **revenue risks, return drivers, and operational inefficiencies**.
The objective was not just to build dashboards, but to **answer real business questions and support decision-making**.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions Answered
- Why did sales drop sharply in September?
- Which products are causing the highest revenue loss due to returns?
- Is the online or in-store channel more volatile?
- Which warehouses are at risk of operational overload?
- Are higher shipping costs justified by order volume?

## 💡 Key Insights
- The September sales decline was **channel-driven**, not seasonal.
- A small group of products accounts for a **disproportionate share of return-related revenue loss**.
- Certain warehouses handle significantly higher order volumes, increasing operational risk.
- Shipping partners show similar total costs, but **cost per order varies**, indicating optimization potential.

---

## 🎯 Business Recommendations
- Prioritize quality audits for products with the highest return-related losses.
- Closely monitor online channel performance and return behavior.
- Rebalance warehouse load to reduce capacity risk during peak periods.
- Optimize logistics contracts based on **cost efficiency per order**, not total spend.
